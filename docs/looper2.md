**Looper2**

This readme file describes the most recent instance of the **phsycial 3D printed** box
representing the *rPi Bare Metal Looper*, it's specific contents, and a bit
about how it fits into my overall *[rPi bare metal vGuitar rig](https://hackaday.io/project/165696-rpi-bare-metal-vguitar-rig)*
project.

This readme can be viewed as **inheriting** certain information and content presented in
the *[Looper1](looper1.md)* readme.  For instance, in 3D printing **this** box, I used the same
**frame for the rPi official 7" touchscreen** that I had already printed for **that** box.

It also contains the same basic core components, the **sound card** (*Audio Injector Octo*)
and **teensy 3.2**, as were in that box, ableit in a sligthly different physical configuration.
