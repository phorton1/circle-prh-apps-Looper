This readme file describes the first instance of the **phsycial 3D printed** box
I created for the *rPi Bare Metal Looper* and how it fits into my overall
*[rPi bare metal vGuitar rig](https://hackaday.io/project/165696-rpi-bare-metal-vguitar-rig)*
project.

As it came first, the subsequent *[Looper2](looper2.md)* can be viewed to **inherit**
information and content from this instance.

Both make use of, and contains, the general core
*[Hardware](hardware.md)* implementation of the *Looper*.
